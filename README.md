## Why a chat app?

As a beginner project, a chat app seemed best to me to understand better the implementation of react concepts like hooks.
Implementation of socketio and how to design a react app from scratch with a Figma prototype is what I learnt.

## Tech stack

Following frameworks/libraries/tools have been used to make this project:

- ReactJS   : fast, scalable and readable
- NodeJS    : community support, easy to integrate and maintain, fast operations (event driven nature makes emitting and listening to IO events a breeze)
- Socket.io : complements nodejs in terms of events
- simple flexbox: makes developing responsive design easier
- Aphrodite : OOCSS because of speed, also compliments with simple-flexbox
- react-scroll-to-bottom : smooth scrolling animations and scroll to bottom button
- react-router: routing in react (query paramaters have been used)

## Future plans

The app is basic as far as a product is concerned. Following feature(s) may be added in the near future:

- End-to-end encryption using standard tools
- Support for multiple rooms
- Private mode
- Connecting with a database to save user chat history
